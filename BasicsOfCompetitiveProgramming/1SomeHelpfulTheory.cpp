//  #include<bits/stdc++.h> -> What is it? -> using this we can manually include vector,stack,queues i.e just
//  include this one header file and you are good to go.

// Why is it slow? -> the more amt of stuff you include, the more compilation time would be required.You end up 
// including so many libraries that you don't even require while coding.

// So how to reduce the compile time & also include this header file? -> precompile this header file.
