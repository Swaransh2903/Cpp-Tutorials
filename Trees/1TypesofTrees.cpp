// When you are learning about a tree , imagine it like a directory which follows a hierarichal structure with
// all its subfolders and files .

// Root: head node

// Children: nodes emerging from a particular node will be referred to as children of that node.

// Leaf node: nodes with no children(they point to NULL)

// Subtree: for a node the subtree will be the tree formed by nodes directly below it (descendants) and are
// reachable from that node without any backtracking.

// Ancestors: for a node , it's immediate parent as well all the above parents(i.e the nodes present in the path
// that the tree took to reach that node) are ancestors of that node.


// Full Binary Tree: Every node will have either 0 or 2 children

// Complete Binary Tree: All the levels are completely filled  (every node has 2 children) except the last level
// wherein nodes are arranged as left as possible

// Perfect Binary Tree: All leafs are at same level

// Balanced Binary Tree: Height of the binary tree should be at max logn where n is the number of nodes

// Degenerate Tree: Every node has a single child
